## Database: How to Populate Data

You can populate the database using the following classes in the codebase:

### Step 1: Populate Ingredient Types

Run this class first to insert all predefined ingredient types into the database:

```java
PopulateIngredientType.main()
```

### Step 2: Populate Sample Data

Then run this class to insert dishes, recipes, and ingredients:

```java
PopulateDatabase.main()
```

This populates the system with example dishes, including nutritional values, allergens, and recipes.

> ğŸ’¡ Make sure your database is running and `config.properties` points to the correct environment.
